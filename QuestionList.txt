    <h3>Problem 9</h3>
    <p>
Write a function min_steps that takes a positive integer n and returns the minimum number of steps needed to reach 1 by applying the following rules:
If n is even, divide it by 2.
If n is odd, either add 1 or subtract 1.
   </p>
   <h3>Constraints</h3>
   <p>n is a positive integer with value at most $10^6$.</p>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <pre>
     min_steps(1) => 0
     min_steps(2) => 1
     min_steps(3) => 2
     min_steps(4) => 2
     min_steps(5) => 3
    </pre>
