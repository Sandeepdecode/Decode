    <h3>Problem 8</h3>
    <p>
Write a function largest_rectangle_area that takes a list of non-negative integers heights and returns the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed using the given heights as the heights of the rectangles.
For example, given the list [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3], the function should return 10, because the largest rectangle can be formed using the heights [2, 2], which has an area of 4 and the heights [5, 6], which has an area of 6, for a total area of 10.
You may assume that the input list has at least one element.
   </p>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <pre>
largest_rectangle_area([2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]) => 10
largest_rectangle_area([3, 6, 5, 7, 4]) => 12
largest_rectangle_area([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) => 9
    </pre>
