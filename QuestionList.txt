    <h1>Problem</h1>
    <p>
Write a function <code>longest_palindromic_substring</code> that takes a string s and returns the longest palindromic substring of s.
A palindromic substring is a substring of a string that is the same when read forwards and backwards.
You may assume that the input string has at least one character.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may assume that the input string has at most length 10^5.
    </p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <pre>
longest_palindromic_substring("babad") => "bab" or "aba"
longest_palindromic_substring("cbbd") => "bb"
longest_palindromic_substring("a") => "a"
    </pre>
