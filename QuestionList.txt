<h3>Problems 13 </h3>
  <p>Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of all the duplicate elements.</p>
  <h3>Example </h3>
  <pre>
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6, 7, 8, 8]
Output: [2, 3, 8]
  </pre>
    <h3>Hint: </h3>
    <p>
    Use a nested loop to compare each element with all the other elements in the array.
    Use a set or map to keep track of the elements that have been found to be duplicates.
    Use the filter method to filter out duplicate elements
