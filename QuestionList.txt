	<h3>Smallest Absolute Difference Pair</h3>
	<p>Given a list of integers, write a function that finds the pair of integers that have the smallest absolute difference. If there are multiple pairs with the same absolute difference, return the pair with the smallest sum.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>Input: [3, 8, -10, 23, 19, -4, -14, 27]</p>
	<p>Output: (-14, -10) or (8, 10) (both pairs have an absolute difference of 4)</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Your solution should have a time complexity of O(n log n) or better.</p>

      You can use any programming language you like. Let me know if you have any questions about the problems or if you need additional clarification.
