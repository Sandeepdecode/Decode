	<h3>Problem 24</h3>
<pre>
Problem 25:
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have.
Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. 
You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
